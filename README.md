[Deployed Website](https://recipe-helper-14aaf.web.app)


## Features
On this website you can search for ingredients one at a time and then select the ingredient you are looking for from a list of options. The ingredients you select are added to list of ingredient that are used to search for recipes. I did it this way to make sure a user can select the correct ingredient. For example, if a user searched for "tomatoes", that could be regular tomatoes or grape tomatoes and a user could add the wrong one by mistake. This way eliminates that proplem.
